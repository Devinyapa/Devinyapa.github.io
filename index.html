            <p>
                Sobawitha is a web application designed to streamline and modernize
                fertilizer management. It offers users a user-friendly platform to search for,
                purchase, and rate fertilizers, as well as providing valuable feedback. For
                sellers, it facilitates procurement, access to instructions, and efficient product
                promotion. The app also fosters communication among agri-officers,
                farmers, producers, and suppliers, enhancing collaboration in the industry.
                This project allowed me to develop expertise in web development, database
                management, and software engineering, while also strengthening my project
                management and teamwork skills. It represents my commitment to
                leveraging technology for positive change in the agriculture sector.
